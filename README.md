aes-cpp
=====
Support PKCS5 and both ECB & CBC



aes-c
=====
Simple c code for aes-128 ECB.
Shamelessly pilfered from https://github.com/chrishulbert/crypto , all credit there.

The idea here is to provide drop in AES support for simple (embedded) applications.
Compiles to about 3k (ROM) on Cortex-M4, due to lookup tables.

No promises on performance, but it does work.

Public domain, use and abuse as you like.

TODO: take a look at the following. It should be about 1.5k-2k less due to fewer lookup tables.
